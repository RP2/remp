        <h2>APPROACH</h2>
        <paragraph>
            <p>At Roof Eidam Maycock Peralta (REMP), what matters is not the securities you select
                or the strategies you pursue, but whether your financial portfolio enables you to live the life
                you envision. We also believe you should know and trust those who help manage your
                investment portfolio. Our approach goes beyond just financial planning. We offer life
                planning. Working with you, we identify your broad life goals—the key factors that make
                you happy. We then develop and refine a financial strategy that will help you pursue
                your interest.</p>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
            <p>We are a Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) with the US Securities and Exchange
                Commission and the California Department of Corporations. We manage more than
                $650 million in brokerage and advisory assets for more than 200 individual and
                institutional clients. Our process is comprehensive, seeking to balance risk
                management, income and investment planning, tax management, retirement planning,
                and estate planning. We draw on our deep experience and
                knowledge—our four partners have an aggregate of more than 90 years in financial
                services.</p>

            <p>As portfolio advisors, we ourselves invest in the same financial instruments as our
                clients. This
                policy aligns our interests with yours. Our mission is to help preserve and build your
                financial
                security and prosperity through comprehensive financial planning and disciplined asset
                management. To fulfill this mission, we uphold the highest standards of professional
                ethics and
                integrity, while providing stellar client service.</p>

                    <p>Our approach balances your need for immediate income with longer-term asset
                        accumulation goals. We begin by analyzing your household budget and cash flows, tax
                        situation, and investment preferences. We subscribe to the philosophy of “paying
                        yourself first” by establishing a lucid capital accumulation and investment strategy for surplus
                        cash flows to build assets. REMP provides sophisticated asset management to help optimize
                        your portfolio's total return for a given risk tolerance. After an exhaustive analysis of
                        your risk capacity, investment objectives and time horizons, we construct a personalized
                        portfolio that meets your needs.</p>

                        can choose how they pursue their work, volunteer, and leisure goals. We work with existing
                        retirement plans and/or install new ones to help maximize all available capital
